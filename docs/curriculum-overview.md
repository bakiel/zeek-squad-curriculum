# Zeek Squad Curriculum Overview

## Programme Philosophy

Zeek Squad uses a play-based, inquiry-driven approach to teach computational thinking and digital literacy. Children learn best when they're engaged, curious, and having fun.

## Learning Objectives

1. **Computational Thinking**
   - Break down problems into smaller steps (decomposition)
   - Identify patterns and similarities
   - Focus on important information (abstraction)
   - Create step-by-step solutions (algorithms)

2. **Coding Fundamentals**
   - Understand sequences and order
   - Use loops for repetition
   - Apply conditionals (if-then logic)
   - Create and use simple functions

3. **Digital Citizenship**
   - Practice online safety
   - Understand digital footprints
   - Respect intellectual property
   - Communicate respectfully online
